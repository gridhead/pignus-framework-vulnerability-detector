# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.


**Please do not work on significant changes or features without first ensuring that the changes are desired.** If there isn't already an issue related to the change you're intending to make, please [create one first](https://github.com/t0xic0der/pignus-framework-vulnerability-detector/issues/new) to discuss your plans. Similarly, even when there *is* already an issue, if the specifics of how it should work aren't clear, please try to sort that out first (by posting comments on the issue) before doing the work.

In general, anything beyond straightforward fixes and adjustments should have an associated issue. This is for everyone's benefitâ€”it ensures that you don't waste effort working on changes that won't be accepted, and makes it easier for other contributors to see what's already being worked on.


## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.


### Before submitting a merge request

After you've finished making your changes, there are a few things to check before proposing your changes as a merge request.

First, ensure that all the checks (tests, mypy and code-style) pass successfully. Merge requests that fail any of the checks will not be accepted.

Squash your changes into logical commits. For many changes there should only be a single commit, but some can be broken into multiple logical sections.The summary line should make sense if you were to use it in a sentence like "If applied, this commit will \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_". For example, "Add a new X", "Fix a bug with Y", and so on.

### Merge request and code review

Once your code is ready, you can submit a new merge request.

After creating the merge request, if you need to make any further changes to your code (whether in response to code review or not), please add the changes as new commits. Do not modify the existing commits, this makes it far simpler for other people to follow what changes you're making. Once the merge request is approved, a final pass can be done to squash the commits down, make updates to commit messages, etc. before it's actually merged.
