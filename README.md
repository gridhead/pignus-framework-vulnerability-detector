# pignus-framework-vulnerability-detector
Version 0.03

A Python GUI application for scanning websites for their frameworks and detecting vulnerabilities off them.

## Usage 
1. Install and upgrade **virtualenv** if not already done by executing ```pip3 install virtualenv --user```
2. Clone the repository on your local drive and make it your current working directory.
3. Create a virtual environment by executing ```virtualenv venv```
4. Activate the virtual environment by executing ```source venv/bin/activate```
5. Install all dependencies for the project by executing ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
6. Run the project by executing ```python3 fwvulgui.py```
7. Scan URLs for framework one-by-one by typing them in the textbox.
8. Scan URLs for framework in a batch by indicating a text file storing them linewise.
9. When done tinkering, deactivate the virtual environment by executing ```deactivate```
